30 Days of Learning React

Welcome to the 30 Days of Learning React repository! In this repository, you will find all the resources and materials that I'll be using over the next month. I'll be diving deep into React to master its fundamentals and intermediate concepts. This repository serves as my comprehensive guide and resource hub for this learning journey.

Overview

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This 30-day learning plan will guide me through a structured approach to understanding React concepts, building projects, and honing my skills.

Goals

    Understand React Fundamentals: Learn the core concepts of React, including components, JSX, state, props, and lifecycle methods.
    Explore Intermediate Topics: Dive deeper into React with topics like hooks, context API, routing, and advanced component patterns.
    Build Projects: Apply what I've learnt by building real-world projects at regular intervals to reinforce my understanding and skills.
    Practice Daily: Commit to daily learning and coding exercises to stay consistent and make steady progress.

Structure

This repository is organized into 30 daily modules, each focusing on specific topics and exercises. Here's a brief overview of what to expect:

    Day 1-5: Introduction to React, setting up your development environment, and building your first React components.
